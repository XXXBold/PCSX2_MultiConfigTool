# PCSX2_MultiConfigTool

This tool can be used to manage diffrent configs and create Shortcuts for direct starting games with PCSX2 https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2.
It's GUI is based on the wxWidgets Library, https://www.wxwidgets.org/.

For now, I just build& tested it for Windows, but it should not be a big deal to make it run on Linux as well.
If you occur any problems, or have some hints for improvments, let me know.

makefile(s) will be added
