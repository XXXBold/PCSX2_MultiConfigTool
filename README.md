# PCSX2_MultiConfigTool

This tool can be used to manage diffrent configs and create Shortcuts for direct starting games with PCSX2 https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2.
This Tool's GUI is based on the wxWidgets Library, https://www.wxwidgets.org/.

For now, I just build & tested it for Windows, using MSYS2/Mingw(https://www.msys2.org/) but it should not be a big deal to compile on Linux as well.

The tool will not modify your original PCSX2 data without your knowledge, if you don't want to use it anymore, just delete it and continue using PCSX2 as before.

If you occur any problems, or have ideas for improvments, let me know.

I'll put precompiled versions for Windows here: https://github.com/XXXBold/PCSX2_MultiConfigTool/releases. 
If you want to compile it yourself, you need a C++11 Compiler and wxWidgets 3.0 dev files. To edit the GUI, use https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder for editing PCSX2Tool.fbp and use the generated C++ Source in the Project.
Tell me if you need help or more information.

Please apologize if something won't work as expected, that's my first Project in C++ :P
