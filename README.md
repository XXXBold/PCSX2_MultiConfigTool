# PCSX2_MultiConfigTool

This tool can be used to manage diffrent configs and create Shortcuts for direct starting games with PCSX2 https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2.
This Tool's GUI is based on the wxWidgets Library, https://www.wxwidgets.org/.

For now, I just build& tested it for Windows, using MSYS2/Mingw(https://www.msys2.org/) but it should not be a big deal to make it run on Linux as well.

The tool will not modify your original PCSX2 data without your knowledge, if you don't want to use it anymore, just delete it and continue using PCSX2 as before.

If you occur any problems, or have ideas for improvments, let me know.

I'll put a precompiled version for Windows @releases. If you want to compile it yourself, you need a C++11 Compiler and wxWidgets 3.0 dev files, tell me if you need more information.

Please apologize if something won't work as expected, that's my first Project in C++ :P
